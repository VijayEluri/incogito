 <h2>About Incogito</h2>

  <p>
    Incogito is the application behind the schedule planner. The application is written by volunteers from javaBin
    (the user group behind JavaZone). Trygve Laugstøl is the current project lead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incogito 2009 is a re-write of last years proof-of-concept that went into production. It is implemented with plain
    old JSP 2.0, JSR-311 and jQuery. It uses javaBins <a href="http://wiki.github.com/javaBin/ems">Event Management
    Suite</a> server as a back-end for the event and session data, and <a href="http://project-voldemort.com">Project
    Voldemort</a> as storage for user preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incogito and the rest of the tool chain is open source, most of it is hosted at github:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/javaBin/ems">EMS</a> - the back-end for JavaZone's sessions</li>
    <li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/javaBin/incogito">Incogito</a> - the attendee front-end for building your own schedule</li>
    <li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/javaBin/submitit">SubmitIt</a> - the presenters tool to submit presentations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
